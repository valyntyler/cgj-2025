## Units

Units are instances of [folds](#folds) that exist on the [game board]. They are
made of [material](#materials) and can interact with other units and the
[environment].

## Folds

Folds are the "instructions" for making each [unit](#units). They describe what
the final shape of the paper will be, regardless of material. Different folds
give units different movement and abilities, and can be augmented by
[material](#materials)] choice.

### Airplane

The paper airplane is one of the most basic units in the game. It moves in a
straight "+" shape and collides with the first object it hits. It can go over
[water] and whenever it collides with anything, it takes [damage] and crumples
its nose.

## Materials

Materials are the actual stuff units get made of. Together with [folds](#folds),
they describe a [unit's](#units) entire set of capabilities. Materials can give
units bonuses like more resistance to wear, or downsides like making them
smaller and thus less effective against higher-class targets.

Materials are a global resource and put together, they determine how many units
you can have in total. Your starting amount of each type is determined per-level
and thus leads to an interesting resource management challenge. Some levels give
you the opportunity to gain aditional materials by collecting them with one of
your [units](#units).

### A4

The gold-standard of unit materials. Not as resistant as [sandpaper] but not as
weak as [sticky notes](#sticky-note).

### Sticky Notes

More plentiful than standard paper, sticky note folds are the "foot soldiers" of
this game's militia. They are disposable and less durable than their larger
counterparts, however their number more than make up for their meek stature.
